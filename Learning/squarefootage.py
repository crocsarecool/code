#first I am going to define a function called Area, which will return a multiplication of 2 numbers

def area(length,width):
    return length*width

# Now I am going to give it 2 variables

house = area(10,10)
Yard = area(20,20)

# Now I am going to tell it to add both variables

total = house + Yard

print (f"the squarefootage is, {total}")

# this last step uses the print function and tells it to say the squarefootage is total
